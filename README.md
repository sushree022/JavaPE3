Project Name- Practice exercise 3

Description- There are 10 problems based on pallindrome, even-odd, number pattern, character and string check, Digit sorting, reverse string and random numbers.
All the problems are solved and test cases for pallindrome, even-odd, number pattern, character and string check and reverse string are written. 

1. CharacterCheck-
		Program to check given input is of which type. Lowercase or uppercase or digit or special character.

2. DigitSorting-
		Program to sort the digits of input number in descending order. Also calculating the sum of even digits of the number and 			checking whether the sum is greater than 15 or not. If greater than 15 then printing true otherwise false.

3. EvenOdd-
		Program to check the given number is between 20 and 30 or not. If the given condition is true then check if the given number 			is even or odd. If the number is even then print Jerry or for odd number print Tom.

4. LetterCheck-
		Program to check each character of given string is a vowel or consonant. For vowel return vowel and for consonant character 			return consonant.

5. NumberGuessGame-
		Program to take 2 inputs from user between 1-50 and 1-100. Then generating one random number between those 2 numbers. Asking 			user to guess the random number till the user guesses the correct number. If the guessed number is less than/greater than/same 			as the random number then print some messages.

6. Palindrome-
		Program to check the given integer is palindrome or not. If palindrome then print palindrome or print not palindrome.

7. Pattern-
		Program to return pattern of a given integer.

8. RepeatString-
		Program to repeat last n characters n number of times.It returns a string which is concat of given string and repeat string.

9. ReverseString-
		Program to return reverse of a string.

10. SumOfNos- 
		Program to return summation of array of numbers.
